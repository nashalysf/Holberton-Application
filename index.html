      <p class="answer1">I aspire to create beautiful, functional & responsive content such as animations, apps, games, sites, etc. Which is why I mixed my art talents with the science of code, to grow in this community, meet people & make friends while creating my career. I aspire to gain experience in UX & UI design, character design, game design, app design, you name it! We’re in a fluid world where technology is growing at a fast pace, so I want to find my path & define my career as a Software Engineer & guide others.

        Ultimately, I would love to be able to create my own studio on the south of Puerto Rico where artists can create, either graphic design, code, photography, music, marketing, or simply explore the digital world. I want to be able to provide access to these tools in order to create an environment where people can meet each other, work together & have a chance to change the world with meaningful work.

        <p class="answer4">About 3 years ago I found my passion for creating content & helping others create their brand & image so I created my own design studio called OrbitNineteen. But in order to provide all the tools necessary I was missing web developing knowledge. I applied the summer of 2022 to the UCF Code Bootcamp where I was accepted & started my journey to the world of development & its communities. While on the Bootcamp, not only did I learn to create pages but also to code on the back-end where I fell in love with the coding language & syntax. I have created various projects along my peers but I’m still growing in this field & have much to learn which is the reason for my desire to keep growing & learning.</p>
